### 🚀 About Me

I'm a senior engineer with **7+ years of experience** building scalable full-stack applications, immersive **2D/3D learning simulations**, and novel UI systems. My work blends creativity with strong experience bootstrapping projects, focusing on:

- 🧪 **Virtual labs** and **simulations** for online higher education
- 🌐 **Fullstack TypeScript** applications (Vue/Nuxt, React)  
- ☁️ **Serverless architecture** in AWS (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CDK/Serverless Framework)  
- 🎮 Web-based **interactive multimedia experiences** using **Three.js + GSAP + P5.js + Tone.js**  
- 🤖 **AI-integrated workflows** for ideation, architecture, refactoring, CI automation, and maintenance

👉 Most of my production work is hosted in private github repositories, so you won’t see many repos here yet. Most of the projects in my personal github are for experiments with new web dev stacks and system architectures.

### 🧠 AI in My Workflow

I approach AI not as a novelty but as a productivity and automation tool in the software development lifecycle. 

Tools I actively use include:

| Tool | Usage |
|------|-------|
| 🧠 Cursor | Multi-agent dev workflow, system design, refactors, code navigation |
| ✨ GitHub Copilot | Inline coding and generation |
| 🤖 ChatGPT | Architecture, research, planning, documentation, MCP Client |
| 📝 Claude Code | System design, rewrite quality, reasoning and refactoring |
| 📄 Agents.md | Standardizing agent constraints across tools and team members |

AI supports my workflows across prototyping, test coverage, code review, exploratory development, and learning new technologies.
